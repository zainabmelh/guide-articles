### User Experience

UX is a buzzword in tech, yet its definition is a bit unclear. What does 'UX' really mean?

There are six major areas that make up User Experience.
1. User Research
2. Interaction Design
3. Content Strategy
4. User Interface/Visual Design
5. Information Architecture
6. Usability Evaluation

While they are seperate parts of the big picture, you willl find that several overlap and infact, if you're working for a startup , often times you become them all.

Let's go a bit more in-depth into these six major areas of UX.

1. User research
 - Understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivation
 - Many different techniques used in research
 - Some companies have budget for a user research lab where you can bring users and then observe their behaviors, feelings, thoughts while they use a prototype, or just sit down one on one and interview them
 - R equires that you have a lot of patience, empathy, and knowledge of the scientific process
 - Often times find yourself out in the field doing what is known as "Guerilla Testing" - thats where you go to a coffee shop and find people to talk about their thoughts on whatever it is that you are working on
 - Skills in observation and being able to deduct what it is that they truly need vs. what it is they say they want

2. Interaction Design
  - Creating engaging interfaces
  - Focus in on how to make app behaviors natural
  - Making sure that you can find what it is that you're looking for with a minimal amount of frustration
  - Aware of human instincts and learned behaviors regarding using technology or any product that you are designing
  - For example look at your screen, are you on a mobile device? a laptop? a desktop? an Ipad? When you hear about repsonsive design and media queries, interaction designers are the ones that decide what should be on the screen and exactly where it should be placed to make it as intuitive as possible for you. They work on wether you would be more willing to swipe left or right to bring up a new screen or delete something on a mobile app. These are the people that decide where the close button is on a browser. If you think about Macs vs. Pc's . When a person first switches over formone to the other, there is a bit of a learning curve because both systems have their browser buttons in different places, as well as scrolling down the page is completely different on a mac vs a pc. that is what Interaction designers hellp to create. The feel and the flow that the user interacts with.					

3. Content Strategy
- Much more than just writing an essay and depositing into a pair of <p> tags				
- Has to be thought out and structured so that google and other search engines can easily find it and rank it higher on the search page
- Work hand in hand with the business development teams and the marketing teams to help create the mood and the message that the site wishes to convey. 
- Just as an image can invoke a feeling, so to can well placed words both firguratively and literally. Figuratively, the turn of a phrase can convey whether you're brand is a young hip, happy, energetic one or whether it is a company that offers security and stability. Literally they have to decide how to format it so that it is easily understood and read. (i.e. how many words per line, is there enough white speace to keep it form looking cluttered). Think of your favorite slogans, they all convey the image the cmpany wants to project if done correctly. Content strategists can make a huge impact on the companys ROI.

4. User Interface/ Visual Design
- Graphic artists, illustrators, fontaphiles
- Designers play with things like the golden ration and white space, color, patterns and typography to provide a visually appealing experience to the user
- Mixing colors, layout and type to convey the mood that the company is trying to project

5. Information Architecture
- Backbone of the product
- Think of them as the rhythm section of a band. They keep the beat going by making things easily found. 
- Organize, structere and label all the content and data and do it in an effective and most importantly sustainable way.   
- A good Information Architect can design the way the navigation of a site and the location of content not just for the present needs but make it scale effortlessly when the time comes to make the site larger.  
- A good skeleton of data and information can make a developers life a lot easier when they have to work on the site. 
- They perform data and content audits and inventory, they work closely with user research to do card sorting and interviews users. 
- If you become an exceptionally skilled information architect, you can pretty much write your own salary.

6. Usability Evaluation
- Taken over by user research unless you have a dedicated UX budget
- Usability evaluation focuses on how well users can learn and use a product to achieve thieir goals
- Work with user research to observe the usage of prototypes and beta products
  - Availability 
  - Accessibility
  - Clarity
  - Learnability
  - Credibility
  - Relevancy
