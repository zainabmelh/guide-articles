## Free Code Camp Video Challenges
This is where we plan Free Code Camp's video challenges. Take a look at our [open issues]()https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/hikes/issues and join our [in our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/hikes) for more casual talk about contributing.

### What are Video Challenges?
Video challenges are 2 minute-long videos that teach high-level concepts relevant to software development. 
Assumptions:
- Viewers will watch these mostly by stumbling upon them in YouTube search. Thus they should be modular and make sense out of order.
- Viewers will watch these on a mobile phone while commuting, so you should write text and draw diagrams as large as possible on the whiteboard.
- Viewers will not take time to complete follow up tasks, like running code or reading additional articles. Assume the video is the only contact they will get with the content.
